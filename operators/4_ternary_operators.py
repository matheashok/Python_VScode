# The ternary operator allows you to assign one value if a condition is true, 
#                                                   and another if it is false:
# Example : Assign a value to x:
# Assign the value "WEEKEND!" if the number is higher than 5, otherwise "Workday":

'''num = 6

x = "WEEKEND!" if num > 5 else "Workday"

print(x)'''

# both above & below gives same o/p

'''num = 2
if num > 5 :
 x = "WEEKEND!" 
else:
   x = "Workday"
print(x)'''

# Note: The ternary operator is not an actual operator, it is a conditional expression,
#                                                          or a shorthand if statement.

# Instead of Elif:
# The ternary operator can be used instead of elif in longer if statements:
# Example : Assign:
# "Fri" if num is 5
# "Sat" if num is 6
# "Sun" if num is 7
# otherwise assign "weekday":

'''num = 2
x = "Fri" if num == 5 else "Sat" if num == 6 else "Sun" if num == 7 else "weekday"
print(x)'''
