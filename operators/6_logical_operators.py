# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

# Test if a number is greater than 0 and less than 10:

'''x = 5
print(x > 0 and x < 10)'''
# returns True because 5 is greater than 3 AND 5 is less than 10

# Test if a number is less than 5 or greater than 10:

'''x = 5
print(x > 3 or x < 4)'''
# returns True because one of the conditions are true (5 is greater than 3, 
#                                                   but 5 is not less than 4)


# Reverse the result with not:

'''x = 5
print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))'''
# returns False because not is used to reverse the result
