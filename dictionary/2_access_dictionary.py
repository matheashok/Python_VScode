# You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:

# Example : Get the value of the "model" key:

'''thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]
y = thisdict["brand"]
z = thisdict["year"]
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)'''

# There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:

# Example : Get the value of the "model" key:

'''thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.get("model")
y = thisdict.get("brand")
z = thisdict.get("year")
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)'''

# Get Keys : The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

# Example : Get a list of the keys:

'''thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.keys()
print(x)'''

# The list of the keys is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary 
#                                                                will be reflected in the keys list.

# Example : Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:

'''car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.keys()

print(x) #before the change
print(car)

car["color"] = "white"

print(x) #after the change
print(car)'''

# Get Values
# The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.

# Example : Get a list of the values:

'''thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.values()
print(x)'''

# The list of the values is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the values list.

# Example : Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:

'''car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change
print(car)
car["year"] = 2020

print(x) #after the change
print(car)'''

# Example : Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:

'''car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change
print(car)
car["color"] = "red"

print(x) #after the change
print(car)'''

# Get Items
# The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.

# Example : Get a list of the key:value pairs

'''thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.items()
print(x)'''

# The returned list is a view of the items of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the 
#                                                   dictionary will be reflected in the items list.

# Example : Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:

'''car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.items()

print(x) #before the change
print(car)
car["year"] = 2020

print(x) #after the change
print(car)'''

# Example : Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:

'''car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.items()

print(x) #before the change
print(car)
car["color"] = "red"

print(x) #after the change
print(car)'''

# Check if Key Exists
# To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:

# Example : Check if "model" is present in the dictionary:

'''thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")
else:
  print("No, 'name' is not one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")'''
