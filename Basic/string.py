'''Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, 
or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:'''

'''print("Hello")
print('Hello')

print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Johnny'")
print('He is called "Johnny"')'''

# Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by 
# an equal sign and the string:

'''a = "Hello"
print(a)'''

# You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
# You can use three double quotes:
'''a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

# three single quotes
b = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''

print(b)'''

# Note: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in the code.

# Strings are Arrays
# Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of unicode characters.
# However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
# Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

# Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])
