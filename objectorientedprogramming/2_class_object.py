# Python Classes/Objects
# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# Create a Class: To create a class, use the keyword class:

# Example: Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:

'''class MyClass:
  x = 5'''

# Create Object: Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:

# Example: Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:

'''p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)'''

# Delete Objects: You can delete objects by using the del keyword:

# Example: Delete the p1 object:

'''del p1'''


# Multiple Objects: You can create multiple objects from the same class:

# Example: Create three objects from the MyClass class:

'''p1 = MyClass()
p2 = MyClass()
p3 = MyClass()

print(p1.x)
print(p2.x)
print(p3.x)'''

# Note: Each object is independent and has its own copy of the class properties.

# The pass Statement: class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class 
#                definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

# Example: 

'''class Person:
  pass'''
