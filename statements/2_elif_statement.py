# The Elif Keyword
# The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, 
#                                                              then try this condition".
# The elif keyword allows you to check multiple expressions for True and execute a block of code
#                                              as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to True.

# Example : 

'''a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")'''

# In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, 
#                                                      so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".


# Multiple Elif Statements
# You can have as many elif statements as you need. Python will check each condition in order and 
#                                                              execute the first one that is true.

# Example : Testing multiple conditions:

'''score = 75

if score >= 90:
  print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
  print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
  print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
  print("Grade: D")'''

# In this example, the program checks each condition in order. Since score is 75, 
#              it prints "Grade: C" (the first condition that evaluates to true).


# How Elif Works
# When you use elif, Python evaluates the conditions from top to bottom. As soon as it finds a 
#            condition that is true, it executes that block and skips all remaining conditions.
# Important: Only the first true condition will be executed. Even if multiple conditions are true, 
#                                           Python stops after executing the first matching block.

# Example : Categorizing age groups:

'''age = 25

if age < 13:
  print("You are a child")
elif age < 20:
  print("You are a teenager")
elif age < 65:
  print("You are an adult")
elif age >= 65:
  print("You are a senior")'''

# When to Use Elif
# Use elif when you have multiple mutually exclusive conditions to check. 
# This is more efficient than using multiple separate if statements because Python stops checking 
#                                                                  once it finds a true condition.

# Example : Day of the week checker:

'''day = 3

if day == 1:
  print("Monday")
elif day == 2:
  print("Tuesday")
elif day == 3:
  print("Wednesday")
elif day == 4:
  print("Thursday")
elif day == 5:
  print("Friday")
elif day == 6:
  print("Saturday")
elif day == 7:
  print("Sunday")'''
